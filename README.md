# Web IQ Quiz

My goal was to sharpen up my vanilla javascript skills and use a tutorial on top of using recorded Zoom class recordings. I used Brian Design to put life into this project and benefited from his simplicity and tiny tips about the steps. The app should have features such as a bar to show progress, color distinction when selecting correct and incorrect answers to name a few.
